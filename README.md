Project 2 - Watch List 

This application was designed for anyone who can never decide what to watch. Instead of going from platform to platform, all the movies and television shows you're interested in are in one streamlined list. Users can search movies and television shows, and add then to their watchlist. One a movie on your watchlist has been seen, you can make it as watched. We also included rating and year made information. 

Tech/Libraries Used: Google Fonts, Bootstrap (minimal), jQuery, Font Awesome, OMDb API, Axios, Express, Handlebars, Morgan, MySQL, Passport & Seqelize
